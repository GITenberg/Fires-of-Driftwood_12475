<p><i>ON what long tides<br>
Do you drift to my fire,<br>
You waifs of strange waters?<br>
From what far seas,<br>
What murmurous sands,<br>
What desolate beaches&#8212;<br>
Flotsam of those glories that were ships!</i></p>

<p><i>I gather you,<br>
Bitter with salt,<br>
Sun-bleached, rock-scarred, moon-harried,<br>
Fuel for my fire.</i></p>

<p><i>You are Pride&#8217;s end.<br>
Through all to-morrows you are yesterday.<br>
You are waste,<br>
You are ruin,<br>
For where is that which once you were?</i></p>

<p><i>I gather you.<br>
See! I set free the fire within you&#8212;<br>
You awake in thin flame!<br>
Tremulous, mistlike, your soul aspires,<br>
Blue, beautiful,<br>
Up and up to the clouds which are its kindred!<br>
What is left is nothing&#8212;<br>
Ashes blown along the shore!</i></p>

<h3 id="When_as_a_Lad">When as a Lad</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN, as a lad, at break of day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched the fishers sail away,<br>
My thoughts, like flocking birds, would follow<br>
Across the curving sky&#8217;s blue hollow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And on and on&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the very heart of dawn!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For long I searched the world&#8212;ah, me!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I searched the sky, I searched the sea,<br>
With much of useless grief and rueing<br>
Those wing&eacute;d thoughts of mine pursuing&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So dear were they,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So lovely and so far away!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I seek them still and always must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until my laggard heart is dust<br>
And I am free to follow, follow,<br>
Across the curving sky&#8217;s blue hollow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts too fleet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For any save the soul&#8217;s swift feet!</p>
<!-- Page 11 -->

<h3 id="Laureate">Laureate</h3>

<p>DEATH met a little child who cried<br>
For a bright star which earth denied,<br>
And Death, so sympathetic, kissed it,<br>
Saying: &ldquo;With me<br>
All bright things be!&rdquo;&#8212;<br>
And only the child&#8217;s mother missed it.</p>

<p>Death met a maiden on the brae,<br>
Her eyes held dreams life would betray,<br>
And gallant Death was greatly taken&#8212;<br>
&ldquo;Leave,&rdquo; whispered he,<br>
&ldquo;Your dream with me<br>
And I will see you never waken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Death met an old man in a lane;<br>
So gnarled was he and full of pain<br>
That kindly Death was struck with pity&#8212;<br>
&ldquo;Come you with me,<br>
Old man,&rdquo; said he,<br>
&ldquo;I&#8217;ll set you down in a fair city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, kingly Death along the way<br>
Scatters rare gifts and asks no pay&#8212;<br>
Yet who to Death will write a sonnet?<br>
If any dare,<br>
Let him take care<br>
No foolish tear be spilled upon it!</p>
<!-- Page 12 -->

<h3 id="Out_of_Babylon">Out of Babylon</h3>

<p>THEIR looks for me are bitter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bitter is their word&#8212;<br>
I may not glance behind unseen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I may not sigh unheard.</p>

<p>So fare we forth from Babylon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the road of stone;<br>
And no one looks to Babylon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save I&#8212;save I alone!</p>

<p>My mother&#8217;s eyes are glory-filled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Save when they fall on me)<br>
The shining of my father&#8217;s face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tremble when I see,</p>

<p>For they were slaves in Babylon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now they&#8217;re walking free&#8212;<br>
They leave their chains in Babylon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I bear my chains with me!</p>

<p>At night a sound of singing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast encampment fills;<br>
<i>&ldquo;Jerusalem! Jerusalem!&rdquo;</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It sweeps the nearing hills&#8212;</p>

<p>But no one sings of Babylon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Their home of yesterday)<br>
And no one prays for Babylon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&#8212;I dare not pray!</p>
<!-- Page 13 -->
<p>Last night the Prophet saw me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, while he held me there,<br>
The holy fire within his eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned all my secret bare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! Sigh you so for Babylon?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I turned away my face)<br>
&ldquo;Here&#8217;s one who turns to Babylon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart traitor to her race!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I follow and I follow!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart upon the rack;<br>
I follow to Jerusalem&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The long road stretches back</p>

<p>To Babylon, to Babylon!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every step I take<br>
Bears farther off from Babylon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A heart that cannot break.</p>
<!-- Page 14 -->

<h3 id="Last_Spring">Last Spring</h3>

<p>THIS morning at the door<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the Spring.<br>
Quickly I set it wide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, welcoming,<br>
&ldquo;Come in, sweet Spring,&rdquo; I cried,<br>
&ldquo;The winter ash, long dried,<br>
Waits but your breath to rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On phantom wing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A brown leaf shivered by,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A soulless thing&#8212;<br>
My heart in quick dismay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgot to sing&#8212;<br>
Twisted and grim it lay,<br>
Kin to the ghost-ash gray,<br>
Dead, dead&#8212;strange herald this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of jocund Spring!</p>

<p>I spurned it from the door.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I longed that Spring<br>
Should come with song and glow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And rush of wing,<br>
Not this, not this!&#8212;But O<br>
Dead leaf, a year ago<br>
You were the dear first-born<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Hope and Spring!</p>
<!-- Page 15 -->

<h3 id="Presence">Presence</h3>

<p>BY a sense of Presence, keenly dear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I, who thought her distant,<br>
Knew her near.</p>

<p>By an echo that most sweetly woke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I, long keyed to silence,<br>
Knew she spoke.</p>

<p>By her nearness and the word she said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I, who thought her living,<br>
Knew her dead.</p>
<!-- Page 16 -->

<h3 id="In_an_Autumn_Garden">In an Autumn Garden</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;TO-NIGHT the air discloses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Souls of a million roses,<br>
And ghosts of hyacinths that died too soon;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From Pan&#8217;s safe-hidden altar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim wraiths of incense falter<br>
In waving spiral, making sweet the moon!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aroused from fragrant covers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The vows of vanished lovers<br>
Take voice in whisperings that rise and pass;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the crisped leaves are lying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A tremulous, low sighing<br>
Breathes like a startled spirit o&#8217;er the grass.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Love! in some far garden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Arcady or Arden,<br>
We two were lovers! Hush&#8212;remember not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The years in which I&#8217;ve missed you&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8217;Twas yesterday I kissed you<br>
Beneath this haunted moon! Have you forgot?</p>
<!-- Page 17 -->

<h3 id="Rose_Dolores">Rose Dolores</h3>

<p>THE moan of Rose Dolores, she made her plaint to me,<br>
&ldquo;My hair is lifted by the wind that sweeps in from the sea;<br>
I taste its salt upon my lips&#8212;O jailer, set me free!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Content thee, Rose Dolores; content thee, child of care!<br>
There&#8217;s satin shoon upon thy feet and emeralds in thy hair,<br>
And one there is who hungers for thy step upon the stair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moan of Rose Dolores, &ldquo;O jailer, set me free!<br>
These satin shoon and green-lit gems are terrible to me;<br>
I hear a murmur on the wind, the murmur of the sea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bethink thee, Rose Dolores, bethink thee, ere too late!<br>
Thou wert a fisher&#8217;s child, alack, born to a fisher&#8217;s fate;<br>
Would&#8217;st lay thy beauty &#8217;neath the yoke&#8212;would&#8217;st be a fisher&#8217;s mate?&rdquo;</p>
<!-- Page 18 -->
<p>The moan of Rose Dolores &ldquo;Kind jailer, let me go!<br>
There&#8217;s one who is a fisher&#8212;ah! my heart beats cold and slow<br>
Lest he should doubt I love him&#8212;I! who love not heaven so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, sweet Rose Dolores, why beat against the bars?<br>
Thy fisher lover drifteth where the sea is full of stars;<br>
Why weep for one who weeps no more?&#8212;since grief thy beauty mars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moan of Rose Dolores (she prayed me patiently)<br>
&ldquo;O jailer, now I know who called from out the calling sea,<br>
I know whose kiss was in the wind&#8212;O jailer, set me free!&rdquo;</p>
<!-- Page 19 -->

<h3 id="A_Pilgrim">A Pilgrim</h3>

<p>ACROSS the trodden continent of years<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To shrines of long ago,<br>
My heart, a hooded pilgrim, turns with tears&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For could I know<br>
That in the temple of thy constancy<br>
There still may burn a taper lit for me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8217;Twould be a star in starless heaven, to show<br>
That Heaven could be.</p>

<p>Bent with the weight of all that I desired<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that I forswore,<br>
My heart roams, mendicant, forlorn and tired,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From door to door,<br>
Begging of every stern-faced memory<br>
An alms of pity&#8212;just to come to thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No more thy knight, thy champion no more&#8212;<br>
Only thy devotee!</p>
<!-- Page 20 -->

<h3 id="Spring_will_Come">Spring will Come</h3>

<p>SPRING will come to help me: she&#8217;ll be back again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Back with the soft sun, the sun I knew before.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She will wear her green gown, the emerald gown she wore<br>
When the white-faced windflowers blew along the lane.</p>

<p>Spring will come to help me: When her waking sigh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifts across my sore heart all the pain will go.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How shall hearts be aching when larks are flying low,<br>
Low across the fields of camas bluer than the sky?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve a tryst with Spring here&#8212;maybe they&#8217;ll be few<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the world grows older&#8212;and shall I delay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because a Winter has stolen joy away?<br>
What cares Spring for old joys, all her joys are new.</p>
<!-- Page 21 -->
<p>Maybe there&#8217;ll be singing in my sorrow yet&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard of such things&#8212;but, if there be not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still there&#8217;ll be the green pool in the pasture lot,<br>
All a-trail with willow fingers, delicate and wet.</p>

<p>Winter is a passing thing and Spring is always gay;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If she, too, be passing she does not weep to know it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time she takes to quicken seed but never time to grow it&#8212;<br>
Naught she cares for harvest that lies so far away.</p>
<!-- Page 22 -->

<h3 id="Cosmos">Cosmos</h3>

<p>THE tiny thing of painted gauze that flutters in the sun<br>
And sinks upon the breast of night with all its living done;</p>

<p>The unconsidered seed that from the garden blows away,<br>
Blooming its little time to bloom in one short summer day;</p>

<p>The leaf the idle wind shakes down in autumn from the tree,<br>
The grasshopper who for an hour makes gayest minstrelsy&#8212;</p>

<p>These&#8212;and this restless soul of mine&#8212;are one with flaming spheres<br>
And cold, dead moons whose ghostly fires haunt unremembered years.</p>
<!-- Page 23 -->

<h3 id="The_Secret">The Secret</h3>

<p>IF I should tell you what I know<br>
Of where the first primroses grow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Betray the secrets of the lily,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring crocus-gold and daffodilly,<br>
Would you tell me if charm there be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To win a maiden, willy-nilly?</p>

<p>I lie upon the fragrant heath,<br>
Kin to the beating heart beneath;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The nesting plover I discover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor stir the scented screen above her,<br>
Yet am I blind&#8212;I cannot find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What turns a maiden to her lover!</p>

<p>Through all the mysteries of May,<br>
Initiate, I take my way&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure as the blithest lark or linnet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To touch the pulsing soul within it&#8212;<br>
Yet with no art to reach Her heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor skill to teach me how to win it!</p>
<!-- Page 24 -->

<h3 id="I_Watch_Swift_Pictures">I Watch Swift Pictures</h3>

<p>I WATCH swift pictures flash and fade<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the closed curtains of my eyes,&#8212;<br>
A bit of river green as jade<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under green skies;</p>

<p>A single bird that soars and dips<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remote; a young and secret moon<br>
Stealing to kiss some flower&#8217;s lips<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too shy for noon;</p>

<p>A pointing tree; a lifted hill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun-misted with a golden ring,&#8212;<br>
Were these once mine? And am I still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering?</p>

<p>A path that wanders wistfully<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With no beginning there nor here,<br>
Nor special grace that it should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So sharply dear,</p>

<p>Unless,&#8212;what if when every day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is yesterday, with naught to borrow,<br>
I may slip down this wistful way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into to-morrow?</p>
<!-- Page 25 -->

<h3 id="Fear">Fear</h3>

<p>I HEARD a sound of crying in the lane,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A passionless, low crying,<br>
And I said, &ldquo;It is the tears of the brown rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the leaves within the lane!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard a sudden sighing at the door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A soft, persuasive sighing,<br>
And I said, &ldquo;The summer breeze has sighed before,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gustily, outside the door!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet from the place I fled, nor came again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With my heart beating, beating!<br>
For I knew &#8217;twas not the breeze nor the brown rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door and in the lane!</p>
<!-- Page 26 -->

<h3 id="Resurrection">Resurrection</h3>

<p>I BURIED Joy; and early to the tomb<br>
I came to weep&#8212;so sorrowful was I<br>
Who had not dreamed that Joy, my Joy, could die.</p>

<p>I turned away, and by my side stood Joy<br>
All glorified&#8212;ah, so ashamed was I<br>
Who dared to dream that Joy, my Joy, could die!</p>
<!-- Page 27 -->

<h3 id="The_Lost_Name">The Lost Name</h3>

<p>THE voice of my true love is low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And exquisitely kind,<br>
Warm as a flower, cold as snow&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is the Wind.</p>

<p>My true love&#8217;s face is white as mist<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That moons have lingered on,<br>
Yet rosy as a cloud, sun-kissed&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is the Dawn.</p>

<p>The breath of my true love is sweet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As gardens at day&#8217;s close<br>
When dew and dark together meet&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is a Rose.</p>

<p>My true love&#8217;s heart is wild and shy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And folded from my sight,<br>
A world, a star, a whispering sigh&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is the Night.</p>

<p>My true love&#8217;s name is lost to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The prey of dusty years,<br>
But in the falling Rain I see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And know her by her tears!</p>

And oh, but she was fair to view, fair to view!</p>

<p>Upon the whiteness of her robe the dew distilled, and on her veil<br>
And on her cheek of carv&eacute;d pearl that gleamed so pale.</p>

<p>(How still the air is in the night, how near and kind the heavens are,<br>

Beneath the shining of the stars her eyes shone soft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love, Love!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the day was long&rdquo;&#8212;&ldquo;Oh, long indeed,&rdquo; she sighing said.<br>
&ldquo;I grow so jealous of the sun, since I am dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DOWN at the docks&#8212;when the smoke clouds lie,<br>
Wind-ript and red, on an angry sky&#8212;<br>
Coal-dumps and derricks and piled-up bales,<br>
Tar and the gear of forgotten sails,<br>
Rusted chains and a broken spar<br>
(Yesterday&#8217;s breath on the things that are)<br>
A lone, black cat and a snappy cur,<br>
Smell of high-tide and of newcut fir,<br>
Smell of low-tide, fish, weed!&#8212;I swear<br>
I love every bless&eacute;d smell that&#8217;s there&#8212;<br>
For, aeons ago when the sea began,<br>
My soul was the soul of a sailorman.</p>

<p>Down at the docks&#8212;where the ships come in,<br>
And the endless trails of the sea begin,<br>
Where the shining wake of a steamer&#8217;s track<br>
Is barred by the tow of the tugboats black,<br>
Where slim yachts dip to the singing spray<br>
And a gay wind whistles the world away&#8212;<br>
Here sad ships lie which will sail no more,<br>
But new ships build on the noisy shore,<br>
And always the breath of the wind and tide<br>
Whispers the lure of the sea outside,<br>
Till now and to-morrow and yesterday<br>
Are linked by the spell of the faraway!</p>
<!-- Page 39 -->
<p>Down at the docks&#8212;when the morning&#8217;s new<br>
And the air is gold and the distance blue,<br>
There&#8217;s a pull at the heart! But best of all<br>
Is to see the sun shrink, red and small,<br>
While the fog steals in (more surely fleet<br>
Than the smacks that run from her white-shod feet)<br>
And clamours of startled calls arise<br>
From bewildered ships that have lost their eyes;<br>
The fog horn bellows its deep-mouthed shout,<br>
The little lights on the shore blur out<br>
And strange, dim shapes pass wistfully<br>
With a secret tide to a secret sea.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Where safe she sleeps upon this virgin height<br>
Captive of dream and smiling with white lips.</p>

<p>Surely a spell, creation-old, was made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For you, O lake of silences, that all<br>

And all his silent men stood near<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While the great fleur-de-lis fell free,<br>

<p>OF old the Winds came romping down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, wild and free were they!<br>
They bent the prairie grasses low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a place to play.</p>

<p>Then, that the gods might hear their voice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On purple days of spring,<br>
They sought the tossing, pine-clad slope<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a place to sing.</p>

<p>Tired at last of song and play,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They found a canyon deep<br>
And in its echoing silences<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They made a place to weep.</p>

<p>Man came, a small and feeble thing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked upon the plain.<br>
&ldquo;Lo, this is mine,&rdquo; he said, and set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A seal of golden grain.</p>

<p>Upon the mountain slopes he gazed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the great pine trees grow,<br>
Then gashed their mighty sides and laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their singing branches low.</p>

<p>He clung upon the canyon&#8217;s ledge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And from its topmost ridge,<br>
Above its vast and awful deeps,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He built himself a bridge.</p>

<p>And angry&#8212;angry most of all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For that brave bridge of gold!<br>
With deep-mouthed shout they hurtled down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To tear it from its hold&#8212;</p>

<p>The girders shrieked, the cables strained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And shuddered at the roar&#8212;<br>
Yet, when the winds had passed, the bridge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Held firmly as before!</p>

<p>Still fairy-like and frail it shone<br>

The distance melts to meet it till both are lost to view<br>
In a little line of glory where the new day beckons through&#8212;</p>

Who, pausing, beckons one of us&#8212;and lo!<br>
Quickly he goes, nor stays to tell us why.</p>

<p>One day I shall look up and see him there<br>
Beckoning me, and with the Passer-By<br>
I, too, shall take the road&#8212;I wonder where?</p>

I know who passed through the dusk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he spoke no word!</p>

<p>I cannot move in my place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am chained and still;<br>
I pray that the moon pause not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By my window-sill.</p>

<p>I have hidden my face in my hair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my eyes are veiled&#8212;<br>
Not even a star must know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How my lips have paled&#8212;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SAD one, must you weep alway?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth&#8217;s ill wedded with despair;<br>
Ringless hand and robe of grey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mock the charms which they declare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sad and sweetly answered she,<br>
&ldquo;What are comely robes to me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would wear a grass green dress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dew pearls for my gems&#8212;no less<br>
Now can comfort me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweet, the shining of your hair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(All forgotten and undone)<br>
Squanders &#8217;neath the veil you wear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold whose loss bereaves the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very sad and low said she,<br>
&ldquo;What is shining hair to me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When from out the rain-wet mold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kingcups borrow of its gold<br>
Sweet and sweet &#8217;twill be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love, O Love! your hand is chill<br>

<p>Sad and patient answered she,<br>
&ldquo;As a bird I would be free;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the spring I would find birth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sweet, forgetful earth&#8212;<br>
Pray you, let it be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>NEVER in all her sweet and holy youth<br>
Seemed she so beautiful! The tired lines<br>
Etch her white face with look so wholly pure<br>
I tremble&#8212;dare I speak to her of aught?&#8212;<br>
She is so wrapt in silence. Yet her lips<br>
Part on a word whose honey she doth taste<br>
And fears to lose by uttering too soon.<br>
I know the word; its meaning is plain writ<br>
In the wide eyes she turns upon the Child.<br>
I dare not speak. No word of mine could find<br>
Its way into a soul close sealed with God<br>
And busy with the thousand mysteries<br>
Revealed to every mother. The soft hair<br>
Veiling her placid brow is all unbound,<br>
Ungentle hands are mine but, trained by love,<br>
She might conceive them gentle&#8212;yet, I pause&#8212;<br>
I&#8217;ll not disturb her thought . . . . .</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
meant those men,<br>
Far-famed and wise, who came to see the Child?<br>
Their gifts lie by forgotten, though the Babe<br>
Smiled on the shining treasure in his hands.<br>
(Those tiny hands like crumpled bits of gauze)<br>
Their sayings were mysterious to me.<br>
&ldquo;A King!&rdquo; they said. What King?</p>
<!-- Page 57 -->
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
mother smiled<br>
As one who knew; and it is true they knelt<br>
As to a King. The thing disturbs me much!<br>
I&#8217;ll ask&#8212;but no . . . . .</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
breathless shepherds, too;<br>
Plain men, blank-eyed with awe, in broken speech<br>
Stumbling some strange, glad tale of midnight sky<br>
A-shine with angel wings! And at their word<br>
Again the mother smiled, as one who sees<br>
No wonder but what well might happen since<br>
A child is born to her. Are mothers so?<br>
And are they prone to dream the careless earth<br>
And distant heaven wait upon their joy?<br>
I&#8217;ll speak to her . . . . .</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
is that in her look<br>
Which answers me&#8212;yet leaves me wondering still,<br>
With wonder so like rapture that I seem<br>
Caught up a breathless second into Heaven?<br>
She turns deep eyes upon me, and she smiles,<br>
Always she smiles! Ah, Mary! could I know<br>
The source of that glad smile&#8212;what would I know?<br>
I dare not dream, save that the mystery<br>
Is not yet given . . . one day I may know!</p>

<p>SHE came to me at Christmas time and made me mother, and it seemed<br>
There was a Christ indeed and He had given me the joy I&#8217;d dreamed.</p>

<p>She nestled to me, and I kept her near and warm, surprised to find<br>
The arms that held my babe so close were opened wider to her kind.</p>

<p>I hid her safe within my heart. &ldquo;My heart&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is all for you,&rdquo;<br>
But lo! She left the door ajar and all the world came flocking through.</p>

<p>She needed me. I learned to know the royal joy that service brings,<br>
She was so helpless that I grew to love all little helpless things.</p>

<p>She trusted me, and I who ne&#8217;er had trusted, save in self, grew cold<br>
With panic lest this precious life should know no stronger, surer hold.</p>

<p>She lay and smiled and in her eyes I watched my narrow world grow broad,<br>
Within her tiny, crumpled hand I touched the mighty hand of God!</p>

A sound he cannot choose but hear&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Hush, hush, the barley and the corn!</i></p>

<p>Far and still far&#8212;through years yet dim<br>

Know, by thy heart&#8217;s prophetic pain,<br>
That one day thou shalt call in vain&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Moan, moan, the barley and the corn!</i></p>

<p>O mother! make thine arms a shield,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sing, sweet Mary!</i><br>
While love still holds what love must yield<br>
Hide well the path across the field!&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sing low, the barley and the corn!</i></p>

<p>THERE lived a man who raised his hand and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I will be great!&rdquo;<br>
And through a long, long life he bravely knocked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At Fame&#8217;s closed gate.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;High place to win;&#8212;<br>
Worn out, he died and, dying, left no trace<br>

<p>He also left a son, who, without care<br>

<p>A WALL impregnable surrounds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town wherein I dwell;<br>
No man may scale it and it has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two gates that guard it well.</p>

<p>One opened long ago, and I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A vagrant soul, slipped through,<br>
Bewildered and forgetting all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wider world I knew.</p>

<p>I love the Town, the narrow ways,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The common, yellow sun,<br>
The handclasp and the jesting and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The work that must be done!</p>

<p>I shun the other gate that stands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the crowded mart&#8212;<br>
I need but glance that way to feel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold fingers on my heart!</p>

<p>It stands alone and somberly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a shaded place,<br>
And every man who turns that way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has quiet on his face.</p>

<p>And every man must rise and leave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His pleasant homely door<br>
To vanish through this silent gate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And enter in no more&#8212;</p>
<!-- Page 68 -->
<p>Yet&#8212;once&#8212;I saw its opening throw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A brighter light about<br>
And glimpsed strange glory on the brow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of someone passing out!</p>

<p>I wonder if Outside may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One fair and great demesne<br>
Where both gates open, careless of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town that lies between?</p>

There would I seek what some one is hiding,<br>

Turning all the pool to brown;<br>
There&#8217;s a thrush who&#8217;s building early,<br>
With his feathers all a-shiver,<br>
And the maple sap is rising&#8212;<br>
But I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;m in town.</p>

<p>Somewhere out there in the country<br>
There&#8217;s a brook that&#8217;s overflowing,<br>
And a quaker pussy-willow<br>
Sews grey velvet on her gown;<br>
Rushes whisper to each other<br>
That marsh marigolds are showing,<br>
And those saucy crocus fellows&#8212;<br>
But I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;m in town.</p>

<p>Long ago, when we were younger,<br>
How those little things enthralled us;<br>
King-birds nesting in the hedges,<br>
Baby field-mice soft as down,<br>
Muskrats in the sun-warmed shallows&#8212;<br>
Strange how all these voices called us!&#8212;<br>
Hark, was that a robin singing?<br>
<i>When&#8217;s the next train out of town?</i></p>

<p>A SINGLE branch of flaming red,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A branch of tawny yellow<br>
And every branch in gorgeousness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A rival of its fellow;<br>
Some russet brown and faded green<br>
With golden shadows in between<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mist-hid sun to mellow.</p>

<p>An instinct as of music near&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A breath the wind is bringing,<br>
Broken and sweet, as from a host<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of swift and solemn winging&#8212;<br>
A mystery born of light and sound<br>
Wrapping our tranc&eacute;d progress round&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sighing and a singing!</p>

<p>Thus in a certain lovely pomp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We leave the Summer lying&#8212;<br>
These are her funeral banners, this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pageantry of dying!<br>
The music that we almost hear<br>
Is wafted from her passing bier&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The singing and the sighing!</p>

<p>With the wind it swells, with the wind &#8217;twill sink,<br>
Dying at last by the sea&#8217;s dim brink.</p>

<p>By mortal hands the bell was hung<br>
By mortal hands &#8217;tis never swung.</p>

<p>When the moon&#8217;s at full and the long tide creeps<br>
It rings o&#8217;er the town that the deep sea keeps&#8212;</p>

<p>The town of Ys, that, unafraid,<br>
Cursed God&#8217;s good bells for the noise they made,</p>

<p>Cursed them well and pulled them down<br>
From every belfry in the town!</p>

<p>For that sin of pride and that pride of sin,<br>
Deathly and soft, a Doom stole in.</p>

<p>It sucked through the stone, it stole through the street,<br>
It rose in the hall, silent and fleet;</p>

<p>Soundless it swept through the market-place<br>
Folding the town in a chill embrace;</p>

<p>No ruth it knew, it heard no call,<br>
Sinner and saint it gathered them all,</p>
<!-- Page 83 -->
<p>Gathered them all, while over them<br>
The bells they had cursed tolled requiem.</p>

<p>YEARS are the seedlings which we careless sow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Time&#8217;s bare garden. Dead they seem to be&#8212;<br>
Dead years! We sigh and cover them with mould,<br>
But though the vagrant wind blow hot, blow cold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No hint of life beneath the dust we see;<br>
Then comes the magic hour when we are old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! they stir and blossom wondrously.</p>

<p>Strange spectral blooms in spectral plots aglow!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here a great rose and here a ragged tare;<br>
And here pale, scentless blossoms without name,<br>
Robbed to enrich this poppy formed of flame;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here springs some hearts&#8217;ease, scattered unaware;<br>
Here, hawthorn-bloom to show the way Love came;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, asphodel, to image Love&#8217;s despair!</p>

<p>When I am old and master of the spell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise these garden ghosts of memory,<br>
My feet will turn aside from common ways,<br><!-- Page 85 -->
Where common flowers mark the common days,<br>

<p>Shall I wake one day to a sky all blue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And meet with Spring in a crowded street?<br>
Shall I open a door and, looking through,<br>

<h3 id="Intrusion">Intrusion</h3>

<p>I BUILT myself a pleasant house.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Content was I to dwell in it&#8212;<br>
Its door was fast against the wind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the gusty swell of it.</p>

<p>It had two windows, high and clear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With trees and skies to shine through them,<br>
They were acquainted with the moon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every star was mine through them.</p>

<p>Its walls were silent walls; its hearth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Held little fires to gladden me&#8212;<br>
And though the nights might weep outside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No sob crept through to sadden me.</p>

<p>Then came your hand upon the latch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Although I had not sent for you)<br>
And all Outside came blowing in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I had not meant it to!</p>

<p>Upon the hearth my tended flame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leapt to a blaze and died in it.<br>
The night sought out a hidden place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I had forgot and sighed in it.</p>

<p>My window that had known the stars<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed suddenly not high at all.<br>
The trees drew back; the friendly birds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept dumbly by, too shy to call.</p>
<!-- Page 90 -->
<p>Said you: &ldquo;It is a pleasant house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But surely somewhat small for two!&rdquo;&#8212;<br>
And at your word my walls fell down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving no house at all, just you.</p>

She saw the fishers sail away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, far and high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The gulls sweep by<br>
Within the hollow of the sky!</p>

<p>She saw the laggard twilight come<br>
And, chased by rippling wakes of foam,<br>
She saw the fisher fleet come home&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown sails a-sheen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the green<br>
With shadows creeping in between!</p>

<p>She saw, when it was evening, all<br>
Day&#8217;s banners stream in crimson rout<br>
Till night&#8217;s soft finger blurred them out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, high and far,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A perfect star<br>
Shone where the keys of heaven are!</p>

<p>&ldquo;O far and constant star,&rdquo; she said,<br>
&ldquo;O passing sail, O passing bird,<br>

<p>OUT upon the bleak hillside, the bleak hillside, he lay&#8212;<br>
Her lips were red, and red the stream that slipped his life away.<br>
Ah, crimson, crimson were her lips, but his were turning gray.</p>

<p>The troubled sky seemed bending low, bending low to hide<br>
The foam-white face so wild upturned from off the bleak hillside&#8212;<br>
White as the beaten foam her face, and she was wond&#8217;rous eyed.</p>

<p>The soft, south-wind came creeping up, creeping stealthily<br>
To breathe upon his clay-cold face&#8212;but all too cold was he,<br>
Too cold for you to warm, south-wind, since cold at heart was she!</p>

<p>Sweet morning peeped above the hill, above the hill to find<br>
The shattered, useless, godlike thing the night had left behind&#8212;<br>
Wept the sweet morn her crystal tears that love should prove unkind!<br>

<p>How silent all the drifting throng<br>

By dim and half-remembered pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And joy but newly born!</p>

<p>The Glory in the Highest flamed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With awful, unremembered ray&#8212;<br>
But quiet as the falling dew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was He who went away.</p>

<p>So swift He went, His passing left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A low, bright door in Heaven ajar&#8212;<br>
With God it was a covenant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To man it seemed a star.</p>

And hands that held my finger tight.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden morn might sparkle through!</p>

<p>Now that life would rest again<br>

Brown the fields and gold the grain,<br>
Brown the little pools of rain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold the leaves that falter down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To brown pavements in the town.</p>

<p>MY soul has left its tent of clay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeks from star to star,<br>
&#8217;Mid flaming worlds that are to be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fruitful worlds that are,<br>
The Voice which spake and said &ldquo;Live on!&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(When Death said, &ldquo;You may die&rdquo;)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The stairway of the sky.</p>

<p>Still must I seek what on the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I sought as fruitlessly&#8212;<br>
The world I knew, the heaven I scorned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost in infinity:<br>
Alone, and on the ageless breath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cosmic whirlwinds spun,<br>
I hurtle through the outer dark<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward some fantastic sun!&#8212;</p>

<p>O God! how happy is the leaf,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweet and soulless thing,<br>
Dying to live but in the green<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of yet another Spring&#8212;<br>
These heights, these depths, these flaming worlds,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;O and O! there is friendship here, there is song.&rdquo;<br>
But they smile to your face, when you turn they stammer and rail<br><!-- Page 113 -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the song of the singer has tears and is over long!</p>

<p>A call comes out of the west and it calls a name,<br>

Sweet, so sweet that it touches my soul with a flame<br>

<p>She wandered where the sands were wet,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A holy monk in cowl and gown.</p>

And of her lips&#8212;a lovely shame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No holy man should think upon.</p>

<p>They hunted her along the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Witch, Witch!&rdquo; they cried and hissed their hate&#8212;<br>
Her hair unbound fell to her knee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a glory where she sate.</p>

<p>Her song she hushed and, wonder-eyed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She gazed upon their bell and book;<br>
The zealous priests were fain to hide<br>

<p>Most innocent she seemed to be<br>

<p>SHE did not go, as others do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With backward look and beckoning;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With no farewell for anything<br>
She passed the open doorway through.</p>

<p>The little things she left behind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie where they fell from hands content&#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fame a forgotten incident<br>
And life a season out of mind.</p>

<p>The spring will find her footstep gone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But spring is kind to vanished things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Camas and buttercups she brings<br>
With green that tears have brightened on.</p>

<p>And we, who walked with her last year<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While April in the lilacs stirred,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will turn with sudden look or word&#8212;<br>
Forgetting that she is not here.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
